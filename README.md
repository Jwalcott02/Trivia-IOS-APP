## 📝 Notes

This project took me longer than expected because I ran into several issues with **Auto Layout constraints** in Xcode. Making sure the labels resized properly to fit longer questions was especially frustrating. I also had to troubleshoot UIButton visibility and storyboard connections before everything started working smoothly. Eventually, I was able to get the functionality and UI looking right by adjusting constraints and writing fallback layout code in Swift.
